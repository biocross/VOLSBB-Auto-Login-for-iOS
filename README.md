VOLSBB Auto Login for iOS
=========================

An App for logging in your iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) device automatically into the Wi-Fi network spanning across the VIT Hostels and campus.


Instructions for Use:

iOS devices don't let you connect to VOLSBB unless you're login the moment you select "VOLSBB" in the Settings App. Obviously if this is the case, you will not be able to switch to this app to login, cause it will drop the Wi-Fi connection the moment you do.

To stop this behaviour, Just go to Settings > Wi-Fi > (tap the small blue arrow beside the network name VOLSBB) > Disable "Auto-Login".

This will stop that "login popup" from coming up the moment you connect to VOLSBB, and then you can switch to my app to login automatically.

Good luck! :)
